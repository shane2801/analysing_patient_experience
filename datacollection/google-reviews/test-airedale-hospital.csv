0, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"I'd just like to wholeheartedly thank the Staff and Doctors for the very informative and friendly service they gave to my family and me. This is why the NHS should be free at point of use. We are very lucky!

My daughter had some dental work under general anesthetic and we were informed about every detail from start to finish. Any worries we had were quickly put to ease.

They told us exactly what they were going to do and gave us after care advice and looked after us amazingly.

We got there early for the appointment with plenty of parking spots for a reasonable price. On site restaurant was great too with a Costa coffee machine and we made use of a wheelchair on the way out as she took a while to come fully around from the anesthetic.

Can't thank them enough! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!!"
1, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"What an absolute wonderful hospital we have in Airedale.  I had the misfortune to visit A&E last Tuesday.  From the word go the reception lady I spoke to right through to the wonderful doctor were absolutely fantastic.  I was seen  in minor injuries almost straight away.  I had three blood tests thinking I may have a clot or a bad infection.  Was told to go home come back three hours later for the results.  Upon returning I was told to go for an X-ray.  They tried to get me in for a scan there and then, but they were very busy.  I was given a strong antibiotic plus blood thinning tablets.  The following morning I was rung to go have a scan at lunchtime.  I cannot thank the staff enough they were so kind.  If I had been royalty I could not have received better treatment. Thank you all so much.  God bless."
2, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Both my husband and I attended for our covid booster yesterday 17/11/22
Can't fault our experience at all. A helpful volunteer showed us where to go and the nurse who actually gave us our injections was very friendly and chatty while remaining professional.
The only downside to our visit to Airedale hospital is parking. The car parks are always busy and expensive."
3, 5 stars ,3 months ago,My 93 year old aunt had to attend the breast clinic. The staff were amazing. My aunt has dementia so all the procedures were doubly difficult. At every point the staff were understanding and caring. As an ex NHS matron I was thrilled to see such excellent care. Well done Breat Clinic staff
4, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Terrible standard of care, I can only hope that someone puts this hospital on the right track about how to treat the elderly and vulnerable..
Hospital acquired infection and pressure sores are not an acceptable method of treatment in my opinion..
Poor communication and I lost count of the numbers of  nurses who said "" I haven't got the computer with me"" !! And couldn't update me about any issues about my relative..
Given the very restricted visiting times,  this is a skill the staff in this hospital need to be reacquainted with....FAST!"
5, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Had a potential blood clot recently. Treatment by ambulance team, a&e and mostly AAU and Jonathan was exceptional. I was very impressed with the care, compassion, communication and thoroughness was outstanding and although long, I was out in the day."
6, 5 stars ,4 weeks ago,"Visited gynacology colpscopy clinic. All the staff I spoke to here were very helpful and the Dr and nurses were great. The Dr even went through some previous test results to explain things fully to me, I felt really listened to and reassured about my concerns. I had a minor procedure which I would have found a bit distressing (not painful but invasive and a little uncomfortable)  had it not been for the Dr and nurses fully explaining step to step what was happening and keeping me informed of what to expect during and after. I arrived early as I heard that parking was an issue but I didn't find it be the case at all, it was a little busy when I left but there were still spaces."
7, 1 star ,a month ago,"Not getting into it here (my thumbs would be worn down to the bone if I tried) but anyone who's had a 'one-star experience' as I have done needs to make sure they escalate it to the right places and get concerns acknowledged and addressed.

For the sake of your own wellbeing but also every patient after you that could potentially receive the same treatment as you."
8, 5 stars ,a month ago,"I was in Cardiac ward 1 for 12 days in Sept and couldn't fault the nurses, doctors and ancilliary staff. They dealt with some difficult circumstances with great professionism and were very friendly, kind and helpful. A big thank you to all of you helping me on the road to recovery."
9, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Our mother is 88, she was given a suspected diagnosis of a TIA. The ambulance took her to the BRI saying that was the best place. 4 hours later in 30 degrees heat my mum puking into a bucket, she still hadn't been seen. So we decided to take her to Airedale hospital,  triage nurse said she'd try to get her seen quickly.  5 hours later she's still waiting!! Disgraceful,  how wud the staff feel if it was their Mother!!!!!!??"
10, 5 stars ,a month ago,Thank you to the wonderful staff at Airedale. I received the highest level of care and treatment from the time I went and right up to discharge. I am indebted to you.
11, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"First visit to Airedale hospital. Staff were awesome and soooo friendly. I sat and watched the staff care for an elderly Scotsman in the waiting area ,they were let’s say wow.Laura the nurse who patched up 👌thanks to all the people who helped me 10/10"
12, 1 star ,5 months ago,I thought Bradford Royal Infirmary for waiting times was bad Airedale is worse when it comes to waiting times especially when there's not many patients in the waiting area majority of patients come in big groups with family members and makes the hospital staff think that they patients. Waited more than 5 hours with my wife just to wait for her results its absolutely shocking. The only thing you get told is you just have to wait I'm afraid these hospitals waste patients precious time. Don't attend this hospital at all costs all these hospitals are the same NHS is finished.
13, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Last time I was an inpatient it was 1987...so after hurting my wrist snowboarding and leaving it 2 weeks, not thinking it was serious...I rang 111 on a Monday evening, GP Tuesday morning and directed straight to A&E. In and out in less than 2 hours. Triaged, xrayed and then put in a cast for a fracture. Phone call next day to book me into the fracture clinic on Friday. Attended fracture clinic, repotted, re x-rayed and seen by the consultant twice in less than an hour. Excellent service from everyone.

Excellent"
14, 1 star ,5 months ago,"This hospital is a joke, 7 months waiting for a simple procedure, scheduled and cancelled twice is the last 4 weeks, not even a courtesy call to let me know, just a letter with no explanation. Disgusting behaviour."
15, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"If you have to go to hospital this must be one of the best. Made welcome and introduced to the nurses by name. Shown to your own area brought water and made comfortable and kept updated as to the lay out for the day. Surgeon and Anestatist  both advised how the procedure would play out. Escorted to theatre and, can't remember any more until the nurse gave me a drink and asked if I was ok. Looked after well with coffee and toast. Given advanced advice that we could leave to give time to arrange transport."
16, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"I live midway between two hospitals and if I need that sort of care and attention I am able to choose which one to go to.

Recently I had that geriatric experience of chest pains and because a friend of mine recently waited seven hours for an ambulance, I decided to ring my long-suffering son to take me to Airedale Hospital to get it checked. His wife rang the hospital to say we were on the way, and I was being assessed within minutes. It wasn't a heart attack and, feeling a bit sheepish, I am back home trying to look as though I am ill."
17, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Always had a good experience with airdale hospital and would have always chosen to go there over bri but I have been in with heart pains and after 4 hours asked the doctor how many people I had Infront of me to get barked at ""your slowing me down!!! You'll get seen when you get seen!!!"". Absolutely horrific behaviour of someone dealing with vulnerable people and are there obviously in crisis. The lass who was at the side of me was saying she wish she'd never come as the same nurse was rude to her. I just came home after that. Should be sacked on the spot. Horrible person airdale need to look at the behaviour of this so called ""employee"" as she's horrible. Will go to bri next time and would advise others to too."
18, 1 star ,2 months ago,"Awful experience here, was taken in by ambulance as they was thought I having a reaction to something due to my face being really swollen.. was left 5 days before given any antibiotics and then they tried gave me the medication I was was allergic to… then was told I was being moved to Bradford.. but got discharged even with the swelling still there

Awful"
19, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Wonderful staff over worked and underpaid!!! Still waiting for pain relief now 😥😥 Conservative government are killing the nhs
20, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Had an Endoscopy procedure and have to say the staff, nurses and consultant were fantastic from booking in to having the procedure. Top class professionalism. A credit to Airedale Hospital."
21, 4 stars ,11 months ago,Been here multiple times since i was a kid and ironically the waiting times weren't that bad for how many people were there. It was like every 30 minutes another person showed up (this was years ago) but i had to wait 4-5 hours. I mean It felt like 30 mins so i didn't care. also... this might of changed now but when i was younger and i mean 6 months old we tried to go to this hospital for burns and since it was a second degree burn they sent me to Wakefield.
22, 1 star ,3 months ago,My best friend had a very traumatic situation and had to wait over 10 hours to be seen very disappointed 😢 in the hospital
23, 2 stars ,11 months ago,"Rubbish. Was told I was only going to be put in hospital for a day. 4th day of sleeping on beds with thinnest provided blankets, I was told I would be discharged within an hour. Took 3 hours for them to come back and let us go! Food is a shambles. Rather starve. Most of the nurses have no idea what they are doing and have to check with the small amount of staff who actually know what they are doing. Honestly."
24, 1 star ,a week ago,"Worst experience ever. Come here at 8pm, still waiting to be seen by a doctor and now its 3.40am. Rude staff"
25, 5 stars ,a year ago,My dad recently suffered a heart attack the level of care and response was exceptional. I just to thank every one of your staff that was involved. The NHS is fantastic and my family thanks everyone of you.

27, 5 stars ,a month ago,The staff are really friendly and considering how busy they are wait times was amazing! Thanks for your help!
28, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I have been to the minor injuries clinic today. It was a pleasant experience, one that will not  be forgotten for a long time. The nurses and doctors were brilliant all through the pandemic.  Would never go to another hospital."
29, 5 stars ,5 months ago,The best hospital around great people work here nothing is too much trouble
30, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very new to the area went into A and E at 2am this morning was promptly seen and sorted out in fantastic time . The staff were brilliant Jamie my nurse done a great job . Couldn't be more impressed.  Thankyou Airdale general !
31, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Diabolical at helping those with mental health problems, utter disrespect and disregard. Last thing you need when already feeling horrible and suicidal. They blatantly know the impact they're having on you and don't care. Absolutely shocking, vile people"
32, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had to attend A&E this morning with my young daughter. Despite the department being busy we were triaged efficiently and seen by a doctor within a couple of hours. The doctor we saw was kind, empathetic and engaging with my young daughter and made a stressful morning so much easier. Thank you as ever to the wonderful NHS staff at Airedale you are all amazing."
33, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A big thank you to all the staff on ward 20 yesterday(26/10/20). The care was excellent and they were always smiling. A big a I thank you to staff nurse Mandy for being so patient and kind to me post op and getting me home.
34, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Words cannot express absolutely amazing hospital beautiful and caring staff. BRI need to take a leaf out of there book Airdale Skipton hospital The best
35, 1 star ,a year ago,Muscle permanently damaged by a so called “qualified vaccinator”. 3 months on I still have pain in the muscle. An official complaint has been made against this hospital who are not fit to be treating any patient. Avoid at all costs
36, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"I've had cause to visit orthopaedics and urology recently and on numerous occasions. Mr Leggetter was friendly and approachable as was Mr Koenig and the urology nurses, who have made me feel confident that I'm in safe hands."
37, 5 stars ,a year ago,All members of Staff are very friendly and highly professional.  I have been to that hospital several times. Can't wait to see the new Hospital built.
38, 1 star ,2 years ago,Really disappointed with the care from the acute assessment ward ...treatment for loved ones coping with cancer and end of life !!! Beware the nursing skills from most on this ward beggar to believe..loved ones left with soiled bedding for over 24 hrs having to sit in a chair while some one could be bothered to come change it .TV in room but only one remote that others on the ward use I hope the nurse sanitised it before others on the ward use it .mind blowing treatment that is upsetting for us never mind the cancer patient sat in a room with no family or friends visiting soiled bedding TV that they cant use ..for god sake have some empathy for  them ..or quit nursing .Nearly a week gone by now no improvement in his care at all..at last  they was moved today from this ward after complaining of the lack of care from the nurses ..I will be writing to my MP regarding the care paients receive from this ward
39, 5 stars ,a year ago,I went to Radiology dept at Airedale yesterday Tuesday 17th August. I would like to say the staff were great especially Fiona!!! Thank you so much Fiona. XX
40, 1 star ,a year ago,"Husband of an acute Parkinson's sufferer. She has just gone to a&e with acute leg pain suffered for 8/10 weeks. In a lot of pain, very scared and shaking badly.
I was not allowed to stay with her as her carer. Bloody disgrace of an excuse for a hospital. And don't give me this Covid nonsense. Even if that was, at some time in the last 14 months, a valid reason for this kind of brutality to patients, anyone with half a brain now knows the risk is non existent. Pathetic."
41, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely wonderful care by all staff on Ward 20 during a recent angiogram. I felt safe and in the hands of intelligent, caring and respectful care givers from consultant to nursing support staff.
Thank you all so much. Thank goodness for our NHS."
42, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Took my 86 year old mother to A&E after she suffered a fall. The staff were brilliant. We were there for a total of 2 hours and my mother was treated really well. Everything explained fully and with care. Thank you very much
43, 5 stars ,a month ago,"A better experience than I could have imagined. Seriously, thank you."
44, 1 star ,3 years ago,Getting an out of hours appointment and finding out the doctor is running late. Staff on late nights at hours does not have people skills. Absolutely shocking service. Been coming every few months for around 2 years & every single time the minimum wait is 1 hour. Sort yourselves out. When you finally do get seen they fob you off telling you that you have to wait for another appointment! Absolute shambles is this place. Whatever it is you need to get it fixed. Are you going to pay for my parking? People parking on grass out here & getting fines left right centre. Joke.
45, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Sorted my gallstone problem out in 4 days from assessment to MRI scan to diagnosis to surgery, brilliant job, feeling better now the first time in ages, thank you to everyone involved."
46, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Great hospital lovely staff one staff especially was a man who I never got his name was just brill 29/10/15 at 1:00am in the a/e department with some awesome tattoos thank you if your reading this.

There are members of staff that don't seem too care much like the sister or High level nurse of ward 2 buzzed for 25 minuits and she walked in through a iv drip on and just no bedside manner

Ward 1 is very nice the staff are very professional and on the 29/10/15 at 10 pm I was moved from ward 2 to ward 1 a lovely female member of staff helped me get there and then took me out for some fresh air thank you if you read this too.

I hope the nice members rub of on the less nice ones then I'd be able to give this hospital full stars."
47, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Daughter visiting area with grandparents from Manchester and had a fall resulting in injury that required surgery. All staff on both A&E and Childrens Ward were fantastic, the facilities available to us and provision as a whole brought us much comfort and relief at a difficult time when were not close to home. I thought parking was ok £8 for over 24 hours...(had expected much worse).  I cannot thank you enough for the care and support we recieved. Thank You!"
48, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great staff on the children's ward. We're sensitive to the fact that my 14year old was much older than most patients. Good that they can do some school and be credited for some attendance whilst in hospital.
Good was truly awful but it was free. We were happy to feed ourselves."
49, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I had an horrendous experience at this hospital & was robbed of my baby girl. I was treated appallingly & don’t want to go there when I’m not breathing, let alone when I am!
I would never trust this hospital again, cons, lies, bullies & cover ups......
I did receive a letter of apology, which meant nothing, they were only sorry that they nearly got caught!
My experience left me traumatised!"
50, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Had great care recently when admitted- had no idea how poorly I was until I was diagnosed- turned out to be life-threatening but the care I received was superb. Caring, hardworking nursing staff working under very pressurised circumstances showing genuine compassion for patients of all ages, throughout the night. Thank you for all you are doing."
51, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"From a and e to ward 9, ICU , Theatre and medical staff and to  the lovely ward 10 staff you are a credit to the NHS despite your challenging resources and staffing levels. I am a health professional myself and would be proud to work on any of the teams mentioned. Ward 10 team has a particular mention -
amazing, lovely people."
52, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Attended this morning for a biopsy, i cannot lavish enough praise on the doctor and 2 nurses who carried out my procedure. They were so caring and professional."
53, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My 5 stars go only to the dental surgeon!! 0 staffs for the state of the hospital & to the staff members (1 was a doctor) who literally laughed at me when  I asked for directions!! was there on Monday to see maxfac surgeon. She was absolutely brilliant and took her time to talk everything over with me & because of the pain I'm in she will try to get surgery done sooner! The waiting room/corridor was packed and I mean packed. The place smelt of a mix of body odour and a used toilet terrible and it was boiling hot. The waiting areas were a mess and unclean. The signage in the hospital is shocking especially for the hospital pharmacy. When you finall find it (after asking staff the directions who just laughed at me and said they had no clue) you have to wait over 40 minutes for your medication and again the smell down there was terrible. It actually smelt like a toilet that someone had done a number 2 (sorry) it was that bad I was nearly sick!!
54, 5 stars ,a month ago,My problem was dealt with quickly and efficiently. Thank you to all staff involved.
55, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I had an appointment with a lovely lady called Jane in the colonoscopy department who guided me through my upcoming procedure with patience, sympathy and a nice sense of humour.
I came away feeling re-assured and prepared for the procedure. It's people like Jane who give the NHS a good name and I'd like to thank her for her kindness."
56, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"Admitted through A & E Friday 02/08/13, A & E staff were amazing, from registering I was seen by the triage nurse within 5 minuted then taken straight through to a room by the staff station and treated with respect,had everything explained as it happened (quite quickly as it was a cardiac issue) along with my partner was allowed to stay with me throughout.The A & E doctor was brilliant. I was the admitted to a ward where again the staff were fantastic.after a few hour  I was then transferred to a specialist ward. Unfortunately some of the Friday evening/night staff were not as good as they could have been, however the staff on the Saturday 03/08 were absolutely amazing!! The NHS needs more staff  like them!! The doctors explained what was going on treatment wise and there was even a registrar on the ward most of the night ready to deal with any issues,again he explained everything ,
Overall a positive experience and would definitely go there again with confidence, both of my children were born there in the past and much prefer Airedale over Burnley and Blackburn hospitals anyday."
57, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"In and out in the same day (28/01/19) for a hernia repair operation. Cannot fault the care and attention I received in ward 20. From the minute I arrived until the minute I left, nothing was too much trouble. Could not have had better care in a fee paying hospital. Special thanks to Mandy (Nurse Practioner), Young (Staff Nurse) and of course my consultant and surgeon Mr Raja Khan."
58, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nothing but praise for Ward 20! I have been admitted onto the ward for IV treatment every four weeks for over a decade.
The Nurse In Charge of the ward is Sharon and she does an AMAZING job!
Reception staff recognise me and always know where I'm being treated. My nurse, who also canulates me (not the easiest job!) is normally Young and he is equally FANTASTIC!! Special thanks also goes to Rachel who ensures I'm kept fed, hydrated and has been a shoulder to cry on on more than one occasion 😘  There is always a friendly face popping in for a catch up and the ward is kept spotless by the lovely cleaning team.
If you have an admission onto ward 20 you will be in sade hands."
59, 1 star ,3 years ago,Absolutely shocking my wife booked in for a section at 7am told to sit in day room at 11am went to ask what was happening nobody even knew we were there they then kept my wife in all day pushing for 24hrs with no food and little water only to cancel on us. Understanding they might have emergencies but with no beds available why did we not get sent home and re book im no expert but surely depriving a heavily pregnant woman of food and water for 24hrs is not good
60, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Just didn't 4 days in Airedale. It's as good as a hospital can be. The staff are almost all brilliant.
61, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"The shock is that there seem to be two hospitals here, some people love it and others hate it.  I suffered here for six months with nurses who were downright rude and unpleasant. one even kept moaning about patients getting in the way of work!!! some workers lovely, but basically Management with an eye on the books prefers the place understaffed and ends up with the staff it deserves.  Not a good place to be ill, especially if you have a disability. arrange to have your accident near here only if you speak fluent medical as the doctors only speak in words of thirty syllables!  signage leaves a lot to be desired if you need to go to another department. Note also that the place only has one toilet for the disabled in which you can enter in a wheelchair and then escape after doing your business, and that is not even signposted!"
62, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Went to airdale hospital with a broken wrist..the staff were lovely and very kind..you all deserved a massive pay rise..
63, 5 stars ,a year ago,Fantastic hospital. Shorter waiting times due to quick handover practice. Staff very polite and professional.
64, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"It has its bad points. Under funded, under staffed and car parking can be a nightmare but the level of care is absolutely superb, they do really care. The A and E department are great, I don't know how we would manage without the staff that work in hospitals, they really are true heroes!"
65, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Hats off to the brilliant staff ""ALL OF THEM"" on ward 13.
Also ACU
I stayed on ward 13 a few years ago and was not impressed
But NOW it's absolutely first class
Thank you one and all
The care given to our granddaughter was A1.
We are very grateful.
One small hiccup Parking fees are extortionate."
66, 1 star ,3 years ago,Very poor.  If you have an elderly / vulnerable patient in this hospital be aware and you will be chasing round in circles to find out what is going on and what happening.  Basic care has been lacking in many areas and I'm not sure the hospital knows what duty of care is (at least a number of areas don't).  Been playing ping pong between wards with little progress.  No diagnosis after 6 weeks in hospital.  Formal complaint being lodged - care of the elderly should NOT be like this.
67, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Some of the staff I encounter treat you like a second class citizen, usually really nice place but went in with my baby daughter with a head injury and they were terrible."
68, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I spent a week between ward 13 and 20 which was opened due to being so busy. The care the nurses gave me was excellent and couldn't be faulted. Even though they are under extreme pressure at times due to understanding.
69, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A credit to our NHS- great, efficient, caring and effective experience at Out of Hours Doctors after calling 111. Was in excruciating pain. From phone call to appointment was less than 1 hour. Great Doctor, reassured me and provided me with pain relief. Can't fault this service. Great NHS service."
70, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Absolutely Shocking! Went to A&E because I was dying in pain was shaking and everything and The receptionist said ""Well why did you come here"" am like wtf Well Where should I go on Sunday evening? .. Nurses called me they started laughing and talking like they dont have patient! And made me wait outside 15mins just so the nurse to come and say You need to go to see ur GP bare in mind I couldn't even walk I was actually really poorly I wouldnt mind waiting even 6 hours because i was in such pain but no Its absolutely horrible"
71, 1 star ,3 years ago,A&E staff are soo rude and nasty they think it's a joke. We as patience understand how busy you are and how much you have to do but as nurses and sister's I'm sure you've heard about the 6C's. They need to do CPD some of them actually most of them. Awful behaviour off the nurses and sister's. None of them knew what's going on. I was half unconscious lying on the bed and they were asking me why I'm here. Check the notes made by the paramedic or check the previous not from the day before I came. Absoululy disgusting behaviour from the pathetic nurses and sister's. Soo stropy it's like they being forced to work. Go home if you don't want to work. You are getting paid for your job nothing is done free for you to behave in such manner.......
72, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Awful, had 3 medical professionals tell me to go to A and E for a cut on my arm which they all said it would need stitches. Then when I got to airdale they decided against it and just used steristrips. A couple of days later it became inflamed and infected. Have also just been told about someone's loved one passing away with what seems to be malpractice at airdale. Would never go there again, avoid and go to Bradford teaching hospital. This place should be under investigation. 0/10"
73, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Set between Steeton and Eastburn this hospital covers and caters for a spectrum of people /patients from the Airedale and Craven areas. Can be difficult to find a car parking space at busy times of the day. Big main entrance into the main part of the hospital where you can find information on the reception desk as to where you want to be. There are very helpful people who are keen to help with the direction of the best way to all the wards etc, etc."
74, 1 star ,9 years ago,"My father was admitted on the 17th May this year. He had fallen at home when his left leg gave way, that was all. With in 7 weeks he was dead. The list of things he then got helped to kill him. Ward 6 has no understanding of demensia  and how to treat them. When meals came round they were put on the tray that goes over the bed but in all cases it was out of reach and no staff member help to feed a patient so they went with out. The hospital has no beds long enough for tall people but 50 beds for obese people( my dad was 6'4'' tall). This meant his legs were unable to stretch out in bed We his family had to demand a doctor to treat him when staff said one wasn't needed. This was found to be needed to treat the problems he started to get. I will never forgive that ward 6 at Airedale hospital in the way my father was treated while on it. After 6 weeks he was so ill they fast tract him out to Nursing home to die so that his death would not be recorded in hospital records. I and my family feel that this ward at Airedale hospital killed my dad by euthanasia through the back door. God help the elderly  in this place."

77, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Make sure you collect all of your deceased relatives possessions asap as things have a habit of going missing. Don't worry, false teeth and clothing seem to be safe, strangely enough jewellery gets lost most often. Having experienced this recently we have since heard from many others who have had similar experiences. Don't bother trying to persue it through P.A.L.S (part of the same ""clumsy"" system) as they will close ranks and deny all knowledge.

It says a lot about the standard of employee that they admit (evidently very forgetful, and unobservant), but a lot more about the type of self serving corporate culture that now infests the dying NHS.

I hope the same lapses of memory don't occur when it comes to remembering patients medication, or remembering the correct procedure to administer a treatment. These are the people who you are trusting to give your loved ones the best care possible at their most vulnerable moments."
78, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"I went to A & E at 8.30 Sunday evening 6th March with a very swollen leg and ankle after being diagnosed with a burst Bakers cyst behind my knee which damaged my calf. After a long wait but well within the 4 hours I was seen separately by two different doctors who thought I should remain in hospital overnight for observation. I went to ward 9 a really friendly and hospitable team of nurses made a fuss of me and got me settled with an elevated leg with ice packs. By this time it was 2am and everyone was apologising for how late it was. At 4am I was woken by a consultant  who wanted to look at me leg, not fun at 4am but how else can you be observed, so it disproves what you read in the press that there are no consultants at the weekend, this was 4am Sunday night!
My whole experience of everyone I met in Airedale was very positive please pass on my thanks to them all. I was discharged in the next day and now recovering at home. John Price."

The receptionist & radiology staff were the only human beings on duty in A&E (and deserve a seven-star rating for being so in the absence of a good example set by better paid clinical colleagues). Not for the first time, either as a patient or a carer, I have found that AGH have absolutely no concept of helping patients with restricted mobility. I came in with what the doctor admitted 'might be' a slipped disc - hugely painful, very difficult to move. If I hadn't brought my hiking sticks in with me, I would have ended up crawling back to the car on my hands and knees. Having already been told that my normal routine includes far more exercise than can be expected from a 64-year-old with existing spine problems and that the sudden acute problem which left me legless happened while mobilising, the doctor's advice to me was 'mobilise', AGH-speak for 'take up your bed & walk'. Unfortunately even AGH doctors don't have the requisite 'Son of God' qualities which actually render that advice effective. Very dispiriting."
80, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Would have been 5 stars but - had Breast biopsy last wednesday really lovely caring staff,  follow up appointment would be sent by post, this arrived this morning 10 minutes before the appointment time, now have to wait another 2 weeks its not on"
81, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"All Doctors, Nurses and reception staff were very helpful, calm and polite."
82, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Staff on reception in audioloogy rude and unhelpful. Plus trying to get my 94 old disabled mum into the car, the driver of an outpatients ambulance pipped me because i was in his way! What a very stressful experience for what was a 10 min app!"
83, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great doctors and nursing i cannot praise them enough for looking after me and making me better thanks phil 👍
84, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Very poor service , they don't look after the sicks kids"
85, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I wouldn’t trust any other hospital 🏥 then Airedale There fantastic I gave birth to my daughter here and the Labour Ward staff and midwifes was fantastic and I also had my o.p here In January 20 my partner also had his o.p here in February  20 and he now been treated now for COVID 19 as he had blood clots on his lungs I can't thank this hospital enough for all the support and care they give there amazing and really take there time in caring for every need ..thank you so much Airedale 💕
86, 1 star ,10 months ago,This hospital I been waiting 6hours before the doctor sees me I could of been dieng but this hospital doesn't care I bought my pregnant wife before she could be seen it took he 6hours
87, 1 star ,2 years ago,The waiting in A&E feels like punishment; I think it is absolutely appalled to make people wait nearly 5 hours before you can be reviewed and seen by a Dr;  they need to honestly look at their systems for seeing and reviewing patients it’s ridiculous
88, 1 star ,7 years ago,"I went there to see the drop in gp (weekends) late at night and the person at the reception was ill coughing everywhere. I finally see the doctor and hes also ill coughing on me, he then tells me to go sign myself into the A&E department which i do finally get seen by another doctor, who is coughing all over me not covering his mouth, and looking incredibly bored when i was talking to him. He kept asking me the same questions over and over. - in the end i never got treated

2 days later and i can now feel myself getting ill, the beginning of a virus, i basically paid £18 in taxi fairs to make myself ill"
89, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very friendly, reassuring and helpful staff who are amazing however I have had doctors be behind their schedules by up to 50 mins a few times could do with improvement schedule wise. Overall, it's a nice, friendly and helpful environment."
90, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Maternity unit was horrendous. Midwife lied on notes to cover her back after my baby was distressed but as it's our word against hers, little can be done. Was left screaming in absolute agony on a drip for a long time until myself and my baby was very distressed for the midwife to then write on notes that the drip was turned down when it absolutely wasn't. It's appalling that not more can be done to investigate.I have had two other babies at the BRI (one on a drip) with no issue whatsoever!"
91, 1 star ,7 months ago,Worst service I took my 3 year old to this place and the service I revised is not at all good they don’t even assess my kid. I waited for nearly 4 hours. I never go back to this place. They don’t care about people
92, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Brilliant, went to A & E  last Saturday morning and had fantastic faultless service and care from start to finish, all staff very friendly and professional, couldn't ask for more, thank you. (From a retired nurse)."
93, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Fantastic hospital. The staff were friendly enough and received a great medical service. It's easy enough to get to by car and parking was easy. So a five star service in general
94, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had a gastroscopy yesterday. The nurses are wonderful, kind, empathetic and utterly professional. I can't speak highly enough of them."
95, 1 star ,9 years ago,"80 year old father breaks hip, admitted October 2013 Ward 10. Two nurses for 28 patients. While replacement could be considered a success post operative care was dire. When your father telephones you in tears to say as his water is taken away and not returned and that they have forgotten to feed him speaks volumes for todays' NHS. Oh don't expect a high regard from Airdale for your loved one's personal hygiene either. They did manage a whole ten minutes of Physio daily. Thankfully we managed to get him transferred to Castleberg Giggleswick :-) which has likely saved his life. He is now on the mend. Airdale need to get their act together, they clearly lack resource to deliver all important basic care skills."
96, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely fantastic service in the out of hours gp service and acute assessment ward. Everyone of the staff went out of there way, friendly, attentive and great smiles. Credit to you all. Amazing and thank you."

101, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"Very impressed with all the nurses and doctors at Airedale with what was a very traumatic time.

108, 1 star ,6 years ago,"They put me in the children's ""rainbow suite"" waiting room when im at least 12 years to old to be with kids who can't speak yet. It is a stupid idea and should be changed. Anyone over the age of 14/15 should have a separate waiting room or be put with the adults and not in the gay rainbow nursery suite or the ninja one next door. It's not on and it needs to be improved. Rubbish service !!"
109, 5 stars ,a year ago,Massive thank you to all the staff at Airedale Hospital on ward 1 and ward 20. You really are our nations treasured hero's and a credit to the NHS.
110, 1 star ,6 months ago,If you have life threatening symptoms and told its a chest infection or to wait a few weeks for treatment get a 2nd opinion  !!!!
111, 5 stars ,10 years ago,"My wife suffered from endometriosis, which meant that it was not possible to naturally conceive the child we yearned. Expert intervention by way of a diagnostic laparoscopy that evolved, during the procedure, into laser treatment to remove the endometrium that smothered her ovaries and rendered her infertile has enabled us to naturally conceive two beautiful boys. I would highly recommend the dedication, expertise and care of the Infertility team to whom we will be forever grateful."
